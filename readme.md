# The Gonzo of Coding: My Journey Through 'Code the Classics'
Hello, code enthusiasts and fellow self-flagellators! ðŸ¤“ Welcome to my modest (and arguably misguided) attempt at the Hunter S. Thompson approach to coding. No, I'm not indulging in a myriad of mind-altering substances; just what my doctor prescribed and coffee. â˜• Rather, I'm "transcribing" the code from the awe-inspiring book ['Code the Classics Vol 1'](https://store.rpipress.cc/products/code-the-classics).

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer
I didn't pen the original code; that's the work of masterful artists behind ['Code the Classics Vol 1'](https://store.rpipress.cc/products/code-the-classics). My humble "contributions" are like adding a fake mustache to the Mona Lisaâ€”a defacement, but amusing to a very specific sort of person (me).

## What is This Repository? ðŸ¤”
In the dimly lit room where my coding happens, I've "transcribed" code from the 'Code the Classics Vol 1'. The aim? To understand what it's like to type code that's actually good because my usual method involves a lot of keyboard smashing and silent prayers to the coding gods.

## Why? Just Why? ðŸ™ƒ
Taking a leaf out of Hunter S. Thompson's typewriterâ€”minus the cigars and bourbonâ€”I'm transcribing these classics to feel the "rhythm of the code," so to speak. I'm yearning to experience the joy of writing code that doesn't resemble spaghetti thrown against a wall.

## Why am I Recommending This Book?
Let me tell you, ['Code the Classics'](https://store.rpipress.cc/products/code-the-classics) isn't just a typical coding bookâ€”it's a gem for anyone with a soft spot for classic games and their history. The book is not only visually stunning but also packed with intriguing stories behind these timeless games. Whether you're a seasoned coder or a retro game enthusiast, this book is a treasure trove of knowledge and nostalgia. Highly recommended!
