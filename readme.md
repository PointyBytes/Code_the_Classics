# The Gonzo of Coding: My Journey Through 'Code the Classics'
Hello there, fellow masochists who enjoy reading other people's code! If you're wondering what this is about, it's basically me trying to do a Hunter S. Thompson but for code, specifically the code from the book 'Code the Classics Vol 1'â€”and no, not the drugs part, the "writing off someone else to understand their genius" part.

ðŸš¨ Disclaimer: I'm not the original author of this code. That credit goes to the brilliant minds behind 'Code the Classics Vol 1'. My contributions are like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa: utterly pointless, but amusing to a very specific kind of person (me).

## What is This?
This repository contains code I've copiedâ€”erhm, let's call it "transcribed"â€”from the book 'Code the Classics Vol 1'. The aim? To understand how real coding feels like, because right now, I'm basically fumbling in the dark, occasionally hitting the right keys.

## Why am I Doing This?
Inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, who transcribed entire books from Hemingway and Fitzgerald to understand the "rhythm of their language," I'm trying to get the feel of what it's like to write code that doesn't suck.
